## 描述


To avoid unsightly burns while tanning, each of the C (1 <= C <= 2500) cows must cover her hide with sunscreen when they're at the beach. Cow i has a minimum and maximum SPF rating (1 <= minSPF_i <= 1,000; minSPF_i <= maxSPF_i <= 1,000) that will work. If the SPF rating is too low, the cow suffers sunburn; if the SPF rating is too high, the cow doesn't tan at all.The cows have a picnic basket with L (1 <= L <= 2500) bottles of sunscreen lotion, each bottle i with an SPF rating SPF_i (1 <= SPF_i <= 1,000). Lotion bottle i can cover cover_i cows with lotion. A cow may lotion from only one bottle.What is the maximum number of cows that can protect themselves while tanning given the available lotions?

## 输入
