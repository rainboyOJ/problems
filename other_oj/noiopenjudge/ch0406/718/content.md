## 描述


An integer interval [a,b], a < b, is a set of all consecutive integers beginning with a and ending with b. Write a program that: finds the minimal number of elements in a set containing at least two different integers from each interval.

## 输入


The first line of the input contains the number of intervals n, 1 <= n <= 10000. Each of the following n lines contains two integers a, b separated by a single space, 0 <= a < b <= 10000. They are the beginning and the end of an interval. 

## 输出


Output the minimal number of elements in a set containing at least two different integers from each interval.
