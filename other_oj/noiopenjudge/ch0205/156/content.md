## 描述


A single-player game is played on a rectangular board divided in R rows and C columns. There is a single uppercase letter (A-Z) written in every position in the board.Before the begging of the game there is a figure in the upper-left corner of the board (first row, first column). In every move, a player can move the figure to the one of the adjacent positions (up, down,left or right). Only constraint is that a figure cannot visit a position marked with the same letter twice.The goal of the game is to play as many moves as possible.Write a program that will calculate the maximal number of positions in the board the figure can visit in a single game.

## 输入


The first line of the input contains two integers R and C, separated by a single blank character, 1 <= R, S <= 20.The following R lines contain S characters each. Each line represents one row in the board.

## 输出
