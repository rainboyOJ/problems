## 描述


There are N nodes in the graph. Given the length of edges between the nodes, find the shortest path of size N and the nodes in the path are all different.

## 输入


First line: one positive integer N (N <= 15).Next N lines: the i-th line contains N non-negative integers (<= 1000) indicating the length of edges between the i-th node and other nodes.

## 输出


One line contains N integers, indicating the indexes of nodes in the shortest path.
