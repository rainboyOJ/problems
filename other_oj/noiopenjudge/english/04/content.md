## 描述


Given the weights and values of N items, put a subset of items into a knapsack of capacity C to get the maximum total value in the knapsack. The total weight of items in the knapsack does not exceed C.

## 输入


First line: two positive integers N (N <= 100) and C (C <= 1000).Second line: N positive integers w[i] (w[i] <= 1000), indicating the weight of the i-th item.Third line: N positive integers v[i] (v[i] <= 1000), indicating the value of the i-th item.

## 输出


One line contains several integers, indicating the indexes of the selected items.
