## 描述


Bessie has gone to the mall's 
jewelry store and spies a charm bracelet. Of course, she'd like to fill 
it with the best charms possible from the N(1 ≤ N≤ 3,402) available charms. Each charm iin the supplied list has a weight Wi(1 ≤ Wi≤ 400), a 'desirability' factor Di(1 ≤ Di≤ 100), and can be used at most once. Bessie can only support a charm bracelet whose weight is no more than M(1 ≤ M≤ 12,880).Given
 that weight limit as a constraint and a list of the charms with their 
weights and desirability rating, deduce the maximum possible sum of 
ratings.
