A number whose only prime factors are 2,3,5 or 7 is called a humble number. The sequence 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18, 20, 21, 24, 25, 27, ... shows the first 20 humble numbers. Write a program to find and print the nth element in this sequence.

## 输入


The input consists of one or more test cases. Each test case consists of one integer n with 1 <= n <= 5842. Input is terminated by a value of zero (0) for n.

## 输出


For each test case, print one line saying "The nth humble number is number.". Depending on the value of n, the correct suffix "st", "nd", "rd", or "th" for the ordinal number nth has to be used like it is shown in the sample output.
