## 描述


An undirected graph is a set V of vertices and a set of E∈{V*V} edges.An undirected graph is connected if and only if for every pair (u,v) of vertices,u is reachable from v. You are to write a program that tries to calculate the number of different connected undirected graph with n vertices. For example,there are 4 different connected undirected graphs with 3 vertices. 

## 输入


The input contains several test cases.  Each test case contains an integer n, denoting the number of vertices.  You may assume that 1<=n<=50. The last test case is followed by  one zero. 

## 输出


For each test case output the answer on a single line.
