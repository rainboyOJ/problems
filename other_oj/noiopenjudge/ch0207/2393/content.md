## 描述


Farmer John is taking some of his cows to the movies! While his truck has a limited capacity of C (100 <= C <= 5000) kilograms, he wants to take the cows that, in aggregate, weigh as much as possible without exceeding the limit C. Given N (1 <= N <= 16) cows and their respective weights W_i, determine the weight of the heaviest group of cows that FJ can take to the movies.

## 输入
